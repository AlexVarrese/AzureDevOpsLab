# Preparing for the lab

For this lab you will require an Azure subscription (your own or a free trial).

# Using the New Navigation UI

In order to have a single flow this lab assumes that you will use the New Navigation UI that is in preview in Azure DevOps. If you create a new organisation it will be on by default, if you have an existing one then to match the labs you will need to enable this preview feature (and you can disable it after the lab to return to the old UI if preferred).

To enable the New Navigation follow these steps:

1. In Azure DevOps, in the top right hand corner click on your profile picture (or initials if no photo), and then select Preview features.
    <img src="images/NewUI1.png" width="350"/>

2. Turn on the toggle for the New Navigation and click on the X close button to close the preview features
    <img src="images/NewUI2.png" width="350"/>

The UI should then reload and you will be using the New Navigation. To turn off the New Navigation repeat the above and untoggle the feature.
