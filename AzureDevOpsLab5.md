# Lab 5: Deploy changes via a Pull Request

This lab will step through making a (trivial) code change and submitting that change via a Pull Request, which, when approved, will then trigger the CI and CD pipeline already in place.

# Step 1: Clone the new branch locally

Navigate to the product backlog by selecting Boards | Backlogs:
